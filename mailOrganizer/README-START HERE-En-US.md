Let's get started!

   In this README, you will learn how to install VSCode with all its dependencies (Node.JS and Python) already included.
   There are several other tools for coding - such as Sublime Text
   Download link: Sublime - https://www.sublimetext.com/download or
   Notepad++ - https://notepad-plus-org/downloads/.
   Both are excellent alternatives to VS Code, each with its peculiarities. The ideal choice will depend on your needs and workflow preferences. Try them out and see which one best suits your style!
   In this tutorial, I will only focus on VSCode (which is my preference)

So... Shall we?

** If you already have your preferred code editor installed, Node.JS but not Python.

** INSTALLING VSCode and Node.JS **

1. If you don't have a Code editor yet (I use VSC), download one to start editing
   your code.

VSC Link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
Note: Choose the OS you use when downloading.

2. To work with Python in VSC, you need to have Node.JS installed (https://nodejs.org/en/download)
   When navigating through the Node.JS installation, in the third part of the "...Next Next Next", you will find the following title and subtitle:
   "Tools for Native Modules"
   "(Optionally install the tools necessary to compile native modules)"
   Check the checkbox "Automatically install the necessary tools. Note that this will also install Chocolatey. The script will pop-up in a new window after the installation completes."
   This way, you will also ensure the installation of necessary dependencies for the configuration
   of your DEV environment.
